This folder contains results from experiments for accuracy/AUC and kernel variance vs number of iterations. 

The code that produced these results is the "run_stdev_and_auc_vs_iters_experiments" method in the "evaluations/experiments/py" file.

Experiment details:
* for each dataset, construct the kernel matrix for a fixed number of iterations
* once the max number of iterations is reached, check the average variance of the kernel matrix
* then train a linear SVM on the test set and obtain the AUC and accuracy
* run the above steps 5 times for each number of iterations
* compute confidence intervals for each set of 5 experiments
